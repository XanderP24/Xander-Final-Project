            <h1>About Project</h1>
<p><strong>Sounds Like Home</strong> is a short animated project I made based on certain sounds I've heard growing up that remind me of home. I wanted to show what home feels like using simple shapes, sound, and movement, which is something that feels genuine and is easy to follow for people.</p>
<p>The animation is made up of six simple scenes. From the kitchen to the table, then outside to the block, and finally into a more personal memory space. I made the animation in After Effects, edited the sounds in Audacity, and built this website using HTML and CSS in PHCode Studio.
